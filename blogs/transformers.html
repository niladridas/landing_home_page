    <h1>Transformers</h1>
  </header>

  <section id="section-2">
    <p>Unlike probably most of you reading this, my theoretical face-off with transformers happened 
      during my undergrad days in electrical engineering, at the Power Systems class and subsequent 
      practical face-off during an internship at a thermal power station. Then came along Michael Bay's 
      Transformer movies. My encounters with Transformers would have ended there by alas, it seems the story is 
      far from being over. Before understanding what the AI buzz word "Transformers" is all about, we will revisit
      some AI concepts and a little bit of story around it.

    <h2>Neural Machine Translation</h2>
    <p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an approach to machine translation that utilizes artificial neural 
      networks to translate text from one language to another.

      <p>
        The structural model for such NMT is a encoder-decoder pair that takes in a group of words
        in English and outputs a group of words in French that is the translation. This structure is made
        out parameters that needs to be learnt. If the French translation is the output \(\boldsymbol{y}\)
        and the English words are the input \(\boldsymbol{x}\), we define \(p(\boldsymbol{y}|\boldsymbol{x})\),
        determined by the encoder-decoder structure as function which when learnt, is maximum for a correct translation
        pair of English and French group of words. For a new group of English words that needs translation, we would then
        simply pass it through the encoder-decoder learnt structure to generate the French translation.

      <p>One of the earliest work to design a NMT is here (2016):
      <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;><i class="ai ai-arxiv-square ai-1.6x"></i></a>
      </a>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A potential issue with this encoder–decoder approach is that a neural network needs to be able to
        compress all the necessary information of a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. This may
        make it difficult for the neural network to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer
        than the sentences in the training corpus. Cho et al. (2014b) showed that indeed the performance of
        a basic encoder–decoder deteriorates rapidly as the length of an input sentence increases.</p>

    The proposed solution was <b>align and translate</b>.
